Purpose
=======

It exits with CRITICAL state if the `bad saves` or `bad restores` counter is not zero.


Details
=======

This script uses `/usr/sbin/nsradmin` from the networker client, installed, and running on the nagios host.

The query used is:

    nsradmin> show statistics
    nsradmin> print type:NSR


Configuration
=============

The local account, used for running nagios plugins, must be authorized to access the networker server data. Just add NAGIOS_USER@NAGIOS_HOST to a networker group that has "Monitor NetWorker" access.


Usage
=====

This script don't accept any argument except the hostname or IP address of the networker server to monitor:

    check_networker_statistics NETWORKER_SERVER
